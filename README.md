YABA
====

YABA (Yet Another Blog Application) is a sample app that uses a well know
problem to experiment on different architectural approaches. Each approach has
it's own branch, so you can move around and take a look.

Approaches
----------
* obvious - a test case of the [obvious framework](https://github.com/RetroMocha/obvious)
* clean-slate - built from the ground up inspired by the blog posts and talks
from Uncle Bob Martin, Matt Wynne, Corey Haines, Victor Savkin, Alistair
Cockburn and many others.
